#### to pass the data as prop to the most nested component, we need to make it pass through every component until each reaches the target component(called prop drilling).

#### To improve this we can have a global object, and then we can access that object to get our data to the target component.

#### for this we have Context API, along with other libraries, Redux(for state management),react-Redux and its easier version is Redux-toolkit(RTK).
